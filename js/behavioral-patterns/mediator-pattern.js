/**
 * MEDIATOR PATTERN
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * - Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of thoer objects interact with one another
 * - Restricts direct communication between objects and forces them to collaborate via a mediator hence reducing
 *   the dependencies between them.
 * - Seems similar to the command pattern
