/**
 * STRETEGY PATTERN
 * Notes:
 *
 * Lets you define a family of algorithms and put each of them in a separate class, and makes their objects interchangeable.
 *
 * Example: A food delivery app's payment strategy can have different payment methods (algorithms). Create a class for credit card, paypay, apple pay, etc.
